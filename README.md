# OpenCv Bindings for iOS and Android

## About the Android binding

For Android, the jar file is already included.  

Status: working.

## About the iOS binding

For iOS, the .a file is 400MB and can't be checked it.  
You have to rebuild it by following the guide in `CreateBindingIos.md`

Status: builds ok. Not working (for some reason none of the bound class are recognized in an iOS app project where this lib is referenced).
